    G: Graph on which to run the simulation. If None, generated using N and the
      args of graph attribute below.
    initial_infected_num: Number of individuals infected at t=0.
    prob_infect: In a single interaction on a single day, what is the chance of
     an Infectious to infect a Susceptible.
    incubation_duration_mean: Incubation period duration distribution mean. In
      days.
    incubation_duration_std: Incubation period duration distribution standard
      deviation. In days.
    prob_recover: Probability to change from Infections to Recovered in a single
      day.
    quarantine_neighbors: When an individual tests positive, whether their
      neighbors are quarantined as well.
    prob_infected_detected: Probability that an Infected individual is tested
      and detected as a carrier in a single day. This encapsulates also the fact
      that many people are asymptomatic or will not be tested (or are not
      quarantined).
    prob_neighbor_detected: Probability that a neighbor of an individual who
      tested positive is himself tested and detected as carriers. This encapsulates

      happens once, once the original individual is tested positive, so this is
      *not* a probability per day.
    prob_exposed_detected: Share of the general population which is tested on a
      single day. Exposed and Infected individuals who are tested are detected
      as carriers.
    days_in_quarantine: Length of imposed quarantine, in days.
    prob_infect_exposed_factor: Ratio of infectiousness between Exposed (in the
      final days before becoming Infected) and Infected. In other words,
      prob_infect_exposed = prob_infect * prob_infect_exposed_factor.
      Set this to 0 to make the Exposed non-infectious.
    duration_exposed_infects: How many days before developing symptoms (becoming
      Infected) an Exposed individual is contagious. Questionable evidence, but
      1-2 produces a reasonable R0.
    steps_per_day: Number of simulation steps per one day of real life time.
    min_degree: Minimal degree of nodes in a generated graph.
    mean_degree: Mean degree of nodes in a generated graph.
    gamma: Parameter of degree distribution in generated graph.
      Higher gamma means a fatter tail of the degree distribution.
    max_steps: Maximal number of steps in simulation. If this number is reached,
      simulation stops.
    verbose: Whether to print some progress indicators.
